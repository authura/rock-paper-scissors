# rock-paper-scissors
Simple rock paper scissors game using basic vanilla javascript.

Current Build:
    -Uses console and prompt to run game
    -Once score reaches 5, that player wins
    -As of now, although result display shows game winner, game does not terminate after winner is determined
    -Right now start game button does precisely nothing
    

Planned updates:
    -Update getWinner function to end game after winner is determined
    -Simple animations to give visual feedback
    -Pleasing user interface
    -add functionality to start game button to initiate game
