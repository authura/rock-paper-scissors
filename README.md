# rock-paper-scissors
Simple rock paper scissors game using basic vanilla javascript.

Current Build:
    -Uses console and prompt to run game
    -Plays up to five rounds, then calculates score and decides winner
    -As of now, any entry other than "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"(currently case sensitive)
    will result in a draw
    -Randomization for computer player is not ideal, yields "Rock" considerably more than the other selections

Planned updates:
    -Update computerPlay function to be true random
    -Implement game in HTML using buttons for player selection
    -Visual scoreboard that displays constantly
    -Simple animations to give visual feedback
    -Pleasing user interface
